What is JavaScript? Explain different types of JavaScript with proper example.
What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language used to make web pages dynamic and interactive.
It runs in the browser and is used to handle events, validate forms, change HTML content, control styles, and communicate with servers without reloading the page.

In simple words:
HTML = structure
CSS = design
JavaScript = behavior

Types of JavaScript (Ways to use JavaScript)
1) Inline JavaScript

JavaScript is written directly inside an HTML tag.

Example:

<button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me</button>


Use: Small actions like button clicks.
Problem: Makes HTML messy and hard to manage.

2) Internal JavaScript

JavaScript is written inside <script> tag in the same HTML file.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    function showMessage() {
      alert("Welcome to JavaScript");
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="showMessage()">Click</button>
</body>
</html>


Use: Medium-size scripts in a single page.

3) External JavaScript

JavaScript is written in a separate .js file and linked to HTML.

script.js

function greet() {
  alert("Hello from external file");
}


HTML file

<script src="script.js"></script>
<button onclick="greet()">Click</button>


Use: Best for large projects, clean code, reusable scripts.

Conclusion

JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive.
It can be used in three main ways:

Inline JavaScript

Internal JavaScript

External JavaScript

External JavaScript is the best method for real projects because it keeps code organized and reusable.
