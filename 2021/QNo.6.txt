What is Widgets? Explain different Features of CMS.
A widget is a self-contained, reusable component on a website that performs a specific function. Widgets are often provided by Content Management Systems (CMS) to make websites more interactive and user-friendly. They allow you to add features to your website without writing any code.

Widgets can display information or provide functionality in a small section of a webpage, such as a sidebar, footer, or header. Common examples include:
-Search boxes to help users find content quickly
-Recent posts or popular articles lists
-Social media links or feeds
-Calendars or event countdowns

Widgets help in enhancing the usability and functionality of a website without complex programming.

Key Features of CMS

A CMS is short for Content Management System, a web application or software that allows users 
to create, manage, and modify digital content like websites and web pages without writing a 
single line of code. With a CMS, even a non-technical person can build and customize websites, 
manage content, and use templates easily from a user-friendly dashboard.

Here are the key features of a CMS:

No Knowledge of Coding is Required
CMS provides a platform for non-developers to build and manage websites without any coding knowledge. 
Users can independently develop and maintain websites without relying on professional developers.
CMS handles website design, fonts, colors, and layout through an easy-to-use dashboard. 
This saves time and allows non-technical users to work efficiently in a technical field.

Easy Collaboration
CMS allows multiple users to work on different areas of the website simultaneously. 
For example, IT professionals can work on security protocols while developers customize the theme or 
add new features. Multiple users can collaborate on the same page at the same time without conflict.

SEO Features
CMS comes with built-in SEO tools that help the website rank better on search engines. Features include:
-Customizing page titles and meta descriptions
-Adding image alt text
-Creating XML sitemaps

Security Features and Extensions
CMS platforms offer security features to protect the website from attacks or vulnerabilities. 
These may include web application firewalls, SSL certificates, custom CDN integration, and 
SSO membership management. Dedicated security teams may also oversee potential issues and 
provide updates.

Predesigned Templates
CMS provides a variety of pre-designed templates and themes to make websites look professional 
and attractive. Users can select and customize templates according to their needs, ensuring that 
the website appearance is always appealing.

Simple Updates
CMS dashboards allow users to make changes like updating images, editing content, or redesigning 
pages without hiring developers. Small updates can be done instantly, saving cost and time while 
maintaining website functionality and aesthetics.

Summary:
Widgets and CMS together provide a user-friendly, functional, and secure way to manage websites. 
Widgets enhance the interactivity of a website, while CMS features make content creation, collaboration, customization, 
and maintenance easy for non-technical users.
