1️⃣ Rules to Create Variables in PHP

Variables in PHP are used to store data like numbers, text, or arrays. Here are the rules to create a variable in PHP:

-Start with a Dollar Sign $:
Every variable name must begin with $.
$name = "Tashi";

-Followed by a Letter or Underscore:
After $, the first character must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore _. Numbers cannot be the first character.
$age = 20;     // Correct
$_count = 5;   // Correct
//$1number = 10; // Wrong

-Case Sensitive:
$Name and $name are treated as different variables.

-Can Contain Letters, Numbers, and Underscores:
Variables can contain letters, numbers, and underscores after the first character.
$user_name1 = "TashiSherpa";

-No Reserved Keywords:
You cannot use PHP reserved words as variable names, like echo, class, function.

2️⃣ How to Create, Store, Access, and Destroy a Session in PHP
Sessions are used to store user information across multiple pages on a website. They are stored on the server.

Step 1: Start a Session

Before using session variables, you must start the session at the beginning of the page:

<?php
session_start(); // Start session
?>

Step 2: Create/Store Session Variables

You can store information in the session using the $_SESSION superglobal array:

<?php
session_start();

$_SESSION['username'] = "Tashi";
$_SESSION['email'] = "tashi@example.com";
?>

Step 3: Access Session Variables

To retrieve the stored session values:

<?php
session_start();

echo "Username: " . $_SESSION['username'];
echo "<br>Email: " . $_SESSION['email'];
?>

Step 4: Destroy Session Variables

You can destroy specific session variables:

<?php
session_start();
unset($_SESSION['email']); // Deletes only 'email'
?>


Or destroy the entire session:

<?php
session_start();
session_destroy(); // Ends session and removes all variables
?>
